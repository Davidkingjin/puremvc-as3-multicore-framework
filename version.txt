TBD: Porting the unit tests. 

1.0.3 - Refactored View.removeMediator method, moving the logic for removing 
        an observer into a removeObserver method (also on IView), which is 
        now called by the Controller.removeCommand method as well as the 
        View.removeMediator method. This fixes the issue described here:
        http://forums.puremvc.org/index.php?topic=308.0
        Also, the Proxy.removeProxy method only attempts to remove the Proxy 
        if it is registered. This was the same change made in the Standard 
        Version 2.0.2

1.0.2 - Facade and IFacade get removeCore method. Model and IModel get 
        removeModel method View and IView get removeView method.
        Controller and IController get removeController method. Corrected
        documentation references to core actors, which were moved together
        into the core package. 

1.0.1 - Corrected issue with SimpleCommands not getting their initializeNotifier
        method called. 

1.0   - Initial AS3 MultiCore Port. Based on PureMVC 2.0.1 feature set.
